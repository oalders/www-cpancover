    WWW::CPANCover - Easy access to the CPANCover API

VERSION
    version 0.0000001

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::CPANCover;

        my $cover = WWW::CPANCover->new;
        say $cover->report_url( 'ACL-Lite-0.0004' );
        # returns http://cpancover.com/latest/ACL-Lite-0.0004/index.html

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a basic wrapper around the CPANCover API. By default it
    caches the JSON returned by CPANCover in order to speed up subsequent
    requests.

NAME
    WWW::CPANCover

CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS
  cache
    You may provide your own caching mechanism, provided it's a CHI object.

        my $cache = CHI->new(
            driver     => 'SharedMem',
            expires_in => '1d',
            size       => 256 * 1024,
            shmkey     => 42,
        );

        my $cover = WWW::CPANCover->new(
            cache => $cache
        );

  ua
    You may supply your own UserAgent object, as long as it provides a get()
    method. You may want to do this, for instance, to bypass the caching
    layer.

        my $cover = WWW::CPANCover->new(
            ua => WWW::Mechanize->new
        );

METHODS
  report_url( $release )
    Requires a release name as its sole argument. Returns undef if no report
    URL exists for this release.

        my $cover = WWW::CPANCover->new;
        say $cover->report_url( 'ACL-Lite-0.0004' );
        # returns http://cpancover.com/latest/ACL-Lite-0.0004/index.html

  all_urls
    Returns a HashRef of all available reports, keyed on release name with
    the appropriate URLs as the values.
